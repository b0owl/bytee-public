# Documentation is a work in progress.

Roadmap: (Not complete) 

- Remove duplicate pieces (i.e the J piece) and add rotation mechanic
- Polish code
- Prep full publication

Note: This project works on windows but is very hacky. I had to run it in a msys enviroment and change around the inclusions in engine/src/rendering.cpp. I will add full and easy windows support sometime in the future, but not for the next few weeks.
